// loads the question function
// import { question } from 'readline-sync';

console.info("Yo! It works!");

// question() is a function that reads user input and returns it as a string,
// similar to how console.log() takes a string and writes it to the console

// As the user for their name with console.info(<message>)
// Read the user's input into a variable you declare with question()
// Use that variable + console.info to greet them, 'Hello, <name>!'
